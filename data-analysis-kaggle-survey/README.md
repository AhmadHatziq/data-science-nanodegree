# Data Analysis of the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey

As a part of the Course: [Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025), an analysis of the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey data will be conducted.

The data can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019/data). 

## 1. Installation

The libraries used in this project are: `matplitlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn` and `sklearn`. 

## 2. Project Motivation

As a student, I am interested in what the data science industry is like. What better way than to perform an analysis of the Kaggle Data Science Machine Learning Survey?

## 3. Analysis

The full analysis can be found in the [notebook](https://github.com/AhmadHatziq/data-science-nanodegree/blob/main/data-analysis-kaggle-survey/notebook/kaggle-survey-analysis-course-project.ipynb) while a summarized blog post can be found [here]().
